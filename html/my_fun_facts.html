        "The Hunger Games" by Suzanne Collins. I like this book because of the
        dystopian setting and the characters.

      <!-- Brief description of why the movie is liked -->
      <p>
        This is my favorite movie because of the visuals and audio combined make
        for such a disturbing and unsettling watch, which is what most horror
        movies don't rely on as much as they do simple jumpscares.
